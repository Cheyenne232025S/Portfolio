## CMDA 3654 Group Project

This project was completed as part of CMDA 3654: Intro to Data Analytics & Visualization and focused on applying foundational data analysis techniques to a real, multi-variable dataset.

Working in a team, we:

- Identified key predictors of state-level SAT performance using exploratory analysis and regression methods

- Visualized similarities between U.S. states based on education and SAT metrics

- Applied clustering techniques and compared data-driven groupings to U.S. Census geographic regions

📁 Tools & methods: Python (pandas, matplotlib/seaborn), regression analysis, clustering, data visualization <br>
📓 Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook (iterative analysis process) <br>

## More About Me
- I am a kind, energetic, and enthustiatic person who takes pride In how I treat others. I value my relationships and recieve immense satisfaction from helping others. Hence why I would love to work in a Data Science niche that works towards a goal of helping others and bettering the lives of todays' and the future generations. I want to do this alongside others of different expertise who have a common desire for purpose in this way.

- Although my first job within data science may not be my dream job described above, I believe it will be of value to me as it begins my professional career as a data scientist. Additionally I believe I will be of value to them for the reasons described above and for my ambition, attitude, hard work, and strive to be successfull.

- With my out-of-major courses I challenged by self to two semesters of Spanish as it is a life long goal of mine to become fluent. I made it to the intermidiate level with all A's. Unfortunately, I had to stop learning in the classroom as I had other pathways to fullfill, but this is still something I plan to pursue

- Outside of learning I have many creative and physical hobbies. For starters, my current favorite, I like to play, practice, write, record, and sound engineer music (Below I will link to a repo with some small audio files containing music I have created). I also enjoy adding to an ongoing junk/scrap journal while I watch my favorite shows. I enjoy reading; recently I have been really enjoying sci-fi books like ready player one, ready player two, and the three body problem series. I also like playing video games; my favorite right now is Arc Raiders which is a game created using AI but also about AI taking over the planet leaving society to live underground. Humans only go topside to scavenge for parts. In the game you deal with Arc (robots) as well as Raiders (other players) who may or may not be friendly. As far as physical activities, I love to go hiking alone and with my closest friends. Next up would be playing basketball which I have been doing since I was very young (with respect to my current age ;) ).
