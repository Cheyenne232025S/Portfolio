### Alpine Butterfly Population Analysis

Statistical analysis and predictive modeling of alpine butterfly populations using long-term weather and population time-series data.  
This project applies regression, time-series, and GLM methods to identify key weather drivers and evaluate out-of-sample predictive performance.

### CMDA 3654 Group Project

This project was completed as part of CMDA 3654: Intro to Data Analytics & Visualization and focused on applying foundational data analysis techniques to a real, multi-variable dataset.

Working in a team, we:

- Identified key predictors of state-level SAT performance using exploratory analysis and regression methods

- Visualized similarities between U.S. states based on education and SAT metrics

- Applied clustering techniques and compared data-driven groupings to U.S. Census geographic regions

📁 Tools & methods: Python (pandas, matplotlib/seaborn), regression analysis, clustering, data visualization
📓 Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook (iterative analysis process)
